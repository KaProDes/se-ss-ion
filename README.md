> I've built **se:ss:ion** to help track my study and work sessions. I got this idea when my trusty old [Casio F-91W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W) which I used for 14 years finally kicked the bucket and I thought of logging my time on online tools but couldn't find one that I liked. Decided to make one on my own as a weekend challenge.

## Feature wishlist (Status)
